<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was my privilege to be in administrative charge of the Naval
Base at Scapa from August, 1914, to May, 1916, until relieved by
Rear-Admiral Prendergast.</p>

<p>The Author, Mr. C. W. Burrows, assumed duty as Cashier of
the Dockyard Section at the Base in May, 1915, and was so
employed until March, 1920, and thus had a long and intimate knowledge of
local doings and surroundings.</p>

<p>He has compiled a unique and profusely illustrated book, which should
prove of surpassing interest, not only to those who only know of Scapa by hearsay,
but particularly to the thousands of officers and men of the Naval, Marine, and
Civil Services of the Crown, the Mercantile Marine, and others who were employed
in and near Scapa Flow. To the latter it will serve as a remembrance of the
incidents, many joyous and some sad and tragic, associated with their sojourn
in the northern mists which shrouded Scapa from the public eye. Part IV.,
dealing with the German ships at Scapa Flow, their dramatic sinking on 21st June,
1919, and the subsequent salvage operations of several of them, is an exceptionally
fine pictorial record.</p>

<p>Owing to the lack of facilities, practically the whole of the Base Establishment
had to be accommodated afloat, and until the arrival of H.M.S. "Victorious" in
March, 1916, as accommodation ship and workshop for the Dockyard Staff and
workmen, the officers and men experienced considerable discomfort. The men
usually found quarters on board the ships upon which they were working, and,
owing to the shortness of notice, they were frequently taken to sea.</p>

<p>A very marked feature throughout the war was the spirit of loyalty, good
comradeship, and emulation which evinced itself among all ranks, ratings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
grades, whether on duty or in recreations. It was this spirit that lightened the
discomforts and difficulties which necessarily occurred, maintained the Grand
Fleet and Base in a healthy state of efficiency, and brought about the breakdown
of the German morale, resulting in the ignominious surrender of the German
ships in November, 1918, and their ultimate transfer to Scapa Flow.</p>

<p>The Author is to be congratulated in providing such a delightful souvenir
of the Great War.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> slight apologia seems necessary to-day for the publication of
a book of war reminiscences (even though they be mainly photographic),
when so many personages, from Admirals and Generals
downwards to the humbler ranks of W.A.A.C.'s and lady typists
in Government offices, have seen fit to record in print their
experiences during the Great War. This little album is being published at the
suggestion of various friends in the Naval Service, with whom the writer has
come into contact during the five years he has been associated with the Royal
Navy at the Grand Fleet Base at Scapa Flow, and, it is hoped, may reach a wider
circle of those to whom the name "Scapa Flow" has hitherto conveyed but
a hazy notion of islands shrouded in perpetual northern mist&mdash;somewhere north
of Scotland, c/o G.P.O., where for five years the Grand Fleet kept its monotonous
vigil in readiness for "the Day," and where finally it had its reward when, in
November, 1918, the German Fleet was ignominiously escorted into the waters
of the Flow, whose defences its submarines had more than once endeavoured,
unsuccessfully, to penetrate.</p>

<p>Various writers&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, "Bartimaeus" and the author of "In the Northern
Mists"&mdash;have written vivid pen pictures of the everyday life of the Navy, and
the photographs reproduced in the following pages, besides recalling many
monotonous&mdash;and some pleasant&mdash;times to those who served at Scapa during
the war, may help to supplement these books by presenting the actual environment
and life of those whose "lawful occasions" necessitated so long a sojourn
in these northern waters.</p>

<p>To many "Scapa" is a name (judging from the warmth of their remarks
when the subject is mentioned) that they would like to eradicate for ever from
their book of remembrance. Their feelings are expressed in a parody of a well-known
song which appeared in the <i>Orcadian</i> of the 5th December, 1918, entitled&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2">SCAPA FLOW<br />
<span class="smcap">(A Hymn of Hate).</span></p>


<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have you ever heard the story of how Scapa got its name?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you haven't then you're slow, because it's earned a world-wide fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It has caused a lot of howling amongst our tars at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I'll tell to you the story as a sailor told it me:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sure a little bit of wastage fell from out the sky one day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it fell into the ocean in a spot up Scotland way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the Sea Lords saw it, sure! it looked so bleak and bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said, "Suppose we start to build a Naval Base up there."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they dotted it with colliers, to provide the tars with work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With provision boats and oilers, that they dared not dodge or shirk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they sprinkled it with raindrops, with sleet and hail and snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they had it finished, sure, they called it Scapa Flow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the Navy's been at Scapa ever since we've been at war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whenever it is over, they won't want to see it more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for years and years to come, whenever sailors congregate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may bet your life you may hear them sing that Scapa hymn of hate.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Curiously enough, the weather forecast given in the <i>Orcadian</i> immediately
below read: "Showers or drizzling rain; local mist."</p>

<p>Certainly even the most enthusiastic Orcadian has to admit that the islands
have few natural features to commend them, and even less of the artificial amenities
of civilisation: country practically bare of trees and vegetation, days in winter
when the sun hardly seems to rise at all, and a climate that seems to hold the

<p>Yet, in spite of all the unkindness of Nature, to many there hangs a cloud
of romance over these far-away northern islands. To those who have the
observing eye, they are rich in the remains of a prehistoric past, with a history
extending far back into the centuries. They possess a coast of unsurpassed
grandeur of form and beauty of colouring, and as they are approached from
the south, or seen from one of the hills of Hoy on a fair day, appear like
some "fairy archipelago set in a summer sea," whilst a distant mirage
often heightens the effect of unreality. In few places does one see such
wonderful sunsets and cloud effects as in Orkney, followed often a little
later by the "searchlight" rays of the Aurora Borealis. But mainly will
those who spent long months and years in Orkney look back, not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
regrets, on the spirit of comradeship which made exile endurable, and which,
in face of a common danger, united even the most varied personalities to work in
harmony for a common cause. Many friendships were made which will long survive
the war; many a "cheery night" in the wardroom will recall pleasant memories
of those who are now scattered over the Seven Seas; and few of the many thousands
who returned to civil life after serving in the Navy during the war but will have
some regrets for the days when they took the rough and the smooth together
(it was mostly rough) in the northern mists of Scapa Flow. Not a few married
into Orcadian families, and the writer recalls his embarrassment on one occasion
when in Stonehouse Naval Hospital recovering from an operation, in discussing
somewhat freely various Kirkwall acquaintances with a naval officer invalided
from the Northern Base, he happened to mention a certain lady's name as one
of the fairest of the Orcadian maidens, whom he understood had married a naval
officer. "Yes," was the reply, "she is my wife."</p>

<p>Until quite recently Scapa Flow and the Orkneys were practically unknown
to the majority of Englishmen, and even to-day very few could point out the
exact location of Scapa Flow on the map. In a well-known London newspaper
of 23rd June, 1919 (after the scuttling of the German Fleet), Scapa Flow was
marked on a map as north of Kirkwall, whereas it will be seen from the map
reproduced in this volume that it is actually south of that town.</p>

<p>It is recalled also that on one occasion a travelling claim of a certain officer
at the Base was returned from the Admiralty with a query as to the car hire
claimed, and the inquiry was made as to why more use had not been made of the
railway facilities!</p>

<p>Scapa Flow was used as an exercise ground for the Home Fleet many years
before the war, with headquarters at the north-eastern corner of the Flow; but
no preparations appear to have been made for its use as a permanent war Base
prior to 1914, and consequently an enormous amount of pioneer work was needed
to render it a safe and efficient harbour for the Grand Fleet and its auxiliaries.
The magic growth of the Base from a few ships to many hundreds of vessels of
all types&mdash;battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, dep&ocirc;t ships, oilers,
colliers, store and ammunition ships, hospital ships, etc.&mdash;constituting the most
powerful Fleet ever assembled in one place, was a gradual process, in which
many novel situations arose and many difficulties had to be met and contended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with. The absence of railway communication, the difficulties of local transport
in weather conditions which at times even large vessels could not face, were
additional obstacles to the hurried improvisation of arrangements, both ashore
and afloat, which were essential to the effectual working of the Grand Fleet.</p>

<p>When Admiral Jellicoe succeeded Sir George Callaghan as Commander-in-Chief
of the newly-named "Grand Fleet" on 4th August, 1914, there were
practically no defences whatever on any of the islands, with the exception of a
few 12-pounder guns landed from the Fleet, whilst there were, of course, no
booms or obstructions across the numerous entrances (Hoxa, Switha, Hoy, and
Holm Sounds) to the Flow. It was not until the end of 1914 and the beginning
of 1915 that sunken ships were placed across the narrower channels, such as
Burra, Water, and Holm Sounds, and that net-boom defence drifters were placed
across the larger ones, and 4-inch and 6-inch guns landed at various batteries,
which were erected to command these entrances. Consequently, during these
early months of the war, the Grand Fleet could not remain in harbour in the
Flow for more than a very brief period, owing to the danger of submarine attack;
indeed, as Jellicoe remarks in his book on the Grand Fleet, it is a wonder that the
Germans did not make a more determined attack on our Fleet during this period.
It was on 16th/17th October, 1914, that the "Battle of Scapa Flow" took place,
when a report that a submarine was in the Flow caused great excitement, and
every available type of craft got under way in the endeavour to locate and
sink it, firing at anything remotely resembling a periscope, and at night-time
sweeping the seas with their searchlights. It was, I believe, never actually
ascertained whether a submarine was present, but, as a result, the Grand Fleet
moved further westwards to Lough Swilly, and did not return to Scapa until a
few months later when the defences were somewhat more secure. Meantime
the organisation of the Base proceeded apace, and H.M.S. "Cyclops" and
"Assistance," Fleet repair ships, were joined by a large and increasing number
of vessels, with Rear-Admiral F. S. Miller in command of the Base. Even so,
continued difficulty was felt to accommodate the even more rapidly expanding
personnel, and Admiral Jellicoe writes regarding the "Cyclops" at this period:
"The manner in which the great demands on her accommodation were met was
a standing wonder to me. In the early part of the war, officers on Admiral
Miller's Staff and others were obliged to make their sleeping berths as best they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
could on the deck or on top of their writing-tables, and it was surprising that
the overcrowding in all directions did not affect health."</p>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of October, 1914, the Base, owing to weather conditions,
was moved from Scapa Bay to Long Hope, where it remained until April, 1919,
when it was transferred to Lyness, where a substantial sea-wall was in process of
completion, and where the Floating Dock was moored. Here it still remains,
though of it "Ichabod" must be written, for it retains only a shadow of its
former activities. The Fleet itself lay north of Weddel Sound, and the auxiliaries
were disposed between Long Hope and Gutter Sound (see <a href="#SCAPAMAP">map</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 687px;">
<a id="IMPERIEUSE"></a><img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="687" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">H.M.S. "Imperieuse" at Long Hope.</span></div>
</div>

<p>One of the earliest arrivals at the Base was H.M.S. "Imperieuse" (previously
"Fisgard I."). She left Portsmouth in September, 1914, in company with
"Fisgard II.," with a party of dockyardmen who were coming up for work in the
Grand Fleet; unfortunately "Fisgard II." capsized off Portland Bill with the
loss of several lives, but "Fisgard I." arrived safely at Scapa Flow, and was
renamed "Imperieuse." During the war she discharged many useful and
important functions, and there are few naval officers who served any length of
time at Scapa who did not at some time pass through her. Primarily she was
the receiving and distributing centre for the mails for the Fleet, and some idea
of the enormous number of letters, etc., dealt with may be gleaned from the fact
that when the Fleet was present some 50,000 items were sorted and despatched
daily. "Imperieuse" was also the headquarters of the staffs of the Admiralty
Port Officer (or King's Harbour Master, as he would be styled at a dockyard
port), Fleet Coaling Officer, Naval Store Officer, Victualling Store Officer, Naval
Ordnance Officer, Cashier, Base Censor, and also accommodated the dockyard
working parties, until at a later stage other vessels arrived which relieved her of
some of these functions. In spite of the limited office and cabin accommodation,
it was an interesting time: the work and the conditions were novel, and there
was always plenty to be done in straightening out the various problems that
arose. One could write a small volume on the personalities one met at the Base
at that time: of a certain genial captain, addicted to forcible but effective speech;
of "V.O.S.O.," equally proficient in supplying flour and potatoes, and music;
of "N.O.S.O.," who insisted on a duly receipted, countersigned, and approved
voucher (in triplicate) before he would part with a minute brass screw; of the
"Drifter King," whose knowledge of Scotch drifter-men and their idiosyncrasies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was profound; of a certain officer in charge of Water Boats, sent to the Base by the
Admiralty as a "gentleman of affairs," whose versatility flowed into such diverse
channels as the organisation of a band, sports, the edition of a ship's magazine,
the supervision of gifts forwarded by the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Fund, and
in numerous other directions; of W&mdash;&mdash; and B&mdash;&mdash; (the "Bullion Brokers"), who
could give you <i>the</i> very latest tip straight from the horse's mouth: these are but
a few of those who enlivened the Base in 1915-1916.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">
<a id="VICTORIOUS"></a><img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="543" height="313" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">H.M.S. "Victorious" at Scapa Flow.</span></div>
</div>

<p>One of the next noteworthy arrivals at the Base was that of H.M.S.
"Victorious," early in 1916. A "dockyard ship" had been awaited for nearly
a year to relieve the congestion on "Imperieuse," and in September, 1915, the
"Caribbean," duly fitted out for the purpose, left Liverpool for Scapa, but, like
"Fisgard II.," sank on the journey north off Cape Wrath. H.M.S. "Victorious"
was then taken in hand, and reached the Base safely in March, 1916. She was well
provided with workshops and accommodation&mdash;being indeed a miniature "floating
dockyard"&mdash;and at times over 500 dockyard artisans were accommodated, although
these usually lived afloat on the ships of the Grand Fleet. The presence of such
a large body of civilian workmen on a ship officered and manned by Service ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and ratings presented several novel problems, and it was largely due to the tact
and consideration of both parties that the experiment, on the whole, was justified
by the results. The possession of such a ship at the Base, by enabling defects
to be adjusted and installations, such as director firing gear, protective deck
plating, flying-off platforms, etc., to be fitted by skilled workmen at the Base
instead of at a southern dockyard, added considerably to the fighting strength
of the Fleet at a time when ships were badly needed, and when our numerical
superiority over the enemy fleet was less marked than at a later period of the war.</p>

</div>

<p>Early in 1917 the addition of a small Floating Dock enabled much useful
work to be done in carrying out minor refits and emergency repairs, and over
200 keels were docked whilst it remained at Scapa.</p>

<p>The Fleet repair ships, H.M.S. "Cyclops" and "Assistance," have already
been referred to, and they should not be overlooked in this connection; both
these vessels carried out, with naval ratings, valuable repairs in connection with
the maintenance of the machinery, etc., of the ships of the Grand Fleet.</p>

</div>

<p>Meantime the duties of "Imperieuse" were still further relieved by the
arrival of other vessels. R.F.A. "Ruthenia," previously a dummy battleship,
became the storeship and headquarters of the Victualling and Naval Store Officers,
and the Fleet Coaling Officer took up his quarters in R.F.A. "Perthshire" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the secluded waters of Pegal Bay; whilst the "Sokoto" (a dep&ocirc;t ship for the
storing and repair of torpedoes) and M.F.A. "Zaria" (repair ship for small craft,
such as drifters, trawlers, etc.) were already at Long Hope.</p>

</div>

<p>Once the early work of organisation was over, life at Scapa, especially for
the Base ships, settled down to a somewhat monotonous routine, varied by
spasms of excitement when the Grand Fleet received orders to proceed to sea,
and one wondered if <i>this</i> time it was
actually a "stunt," or merely once
more "P.Z." The summer of 1916
was not, however, without incident.
The return of the Fleet from Jutland,
on the morning of 2nd June, was an
exciting moment, followed a few days
later by the dramatic news that Lord
Kitchener had been lost in H.M.S.
"Hampshire" off Marwick Head, and
later in the month the King paid a
short visit to the Fleet. Just over a
year later, in July, 1917, the battleship
"Vanguard" blew up with the loss of
practically the entire ship's company.
The explosion occurred late at night
(about eleven o'clock), and the vivid
flames which illumined the twilight sky
(it was still fairly light) were followed
by a dense column of smoke rising
about half a mile into the sky. Everyone
rushed on deck clad in a varied
assortment of night attire, every available craft was rushed to the scene of the
disaster, and anti-submarine precautions were ordered to be taken. Some idea of
the force of the explosion may be gathered from the fact the "Vanguard's"
pinnace was blown clean over the next ship in the line, and landed in the water
on the other side, practically undamaged, whilst it was reported that a packet of
Treasury notes was picked up intact next day on the neighbouring island of Flotta.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December, 1917, our Fleet was strengthened by the
arrival of four U.S. battleships, which were incorporated into the Grand Fleet
as the Sixth Battle Squadron. The presence of the Americans contributed some
new features into the life of the Base, notably in the domain of sport, and baseball
became for a time quite a popular game. The importance of games and sport,
incidentally, has always been recognised in the Navy, and nowhere was the need
for recreation more essential for the maintenance of morale and fitness than at
Scapa. Football was played all the year round (there being no summer to speak
of in these northern latitudes) on Flotta (the playing ground of the Grand Fleet),
and at Long Hope and Lyness by the Base ships, whilst two or three rough golf
courses were laid out for the use of officers. Admiral Jellicoe used often to be
seen playing a hurried game round the course at Flotta in the few moments of
relaxation he was able to snatch from his work on the "Iron Duke." Tennis
was hardly a possible game, owing to the inclement weather and the continual
winds, but one or two ash and gravel courts were made at the shore batteries.
Sailing and pulling matches were frequently arranged, and the sports of the
Base ships at Long Hope became an annual event greatly looked forward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by the local inhabitants as well as by the ships' companies. Another annual
event of great interest was the Grand Fleet Boxing Championship Contest, held
outside the Y.M.C.A. Hut at Flotta. These competitions were witnessed by as
many as 10,000 men, and the writer recalls an inspiring speech made by Admiral
Beatty to this great gathering of sailors in July, 1917, after he had distributed the
prizes. Prince Albert, incidentally, was present on this occasion.</p>

<p>The work of the Y.M.C.A. Huts, at Flotta and Long Hope, and of the Church
Army Hut later at Lyness, was of great value in providing almost the only recreation
and social amusement obtainable outside of one's ship, and the ladies
who volunteered for service in these lonely islands deserve every praise for the
way in which they cared for the comfort and entertainment of the men during
the war.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The "Green Room" of a Battleship: Officers making up for a Show.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Gardening became at one period quite a popular, as well as profitable, recreation
amongst many of the men and officers, and although neither the soil nor the
climate was very promising, some remarkably good crops of vegetables were
obtained, which were especially welcome in view of the difficulties of obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fresh fruit and vegetables on board ship. One enterprising ship actually raised
chickens and pigs on one of the islands, although the uncertain movements of
the ships made the feeding question a difficult problem at times.</p>

<p>A variety of indoor amusements was provided on board ship. The "movies"
were always a standing attraction, whilst billiards proved a popular war-time
innovation, the movement of the ship adding a fascinating element of uncertainty
to the game! Some excellent "shows" were organised, and an improvised stage,
with the necessary accessories, was rigged up on the Frozen Meat Ship "Gourko,"
which proved an ideal "theatre ship," although it was advisable to come warmly
clad, as the auditorium was over the refrigerating room!</p>

<p>Very little of interest occurred at the Base in the early part of 1918, and
the Grand Fleet spent a considerable time in this year at Rosyth, where the completion
of the boom defences permitted exercises and firing to be carried out with
almost the same degree of safety and convenience as at Scapa. The progress
of the war was, as elsewhere, watched with great excitement towards the end
of the year, and the signing of the Armistice on the 11th November, 1918, came
as a great relief after four years of strain and effort. One of the most welcome
of the minor changes effected by the Armistice was the removal of the Censorship
which had been rigorously maintained during the war, and for the first time the
general public became aware of the jealously guarded secret of the location of
the Northern Base of the Grand Fleet.</p>

</div>

<p>The entry of the German ships into Scapa Flow for internment towards the
end of the month was a memorable sight, which will not soon be forgotten by
those who witnessed it. The vessels came north from Rosyth in detachments,
and each group of ships entered the Flow in the grey dawn of an autumn morning,
escorted by our own ships. Little groups of spectators who had gathered at
points of vantage on the islands identified the various ships as they entered with
great interest, and more especially in the case of those who had last met them
in action. It was some compensation for those who had spent so many months
and years at Scapa that "the Day" should have culminated in such a dramatic
and complete surrender of the German Fleet, although it seemed then almost
unthinkable that such a surrender should have been made without at least an effort
to strike a last blow, or in the last resort to scuttle their ships in port. That
some, at any rate, of the officers of the German Navy had these feelings was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
evident from the destruction of one of their submarines just before the Armistice
in the act of entering the Flow, whose outer defences it had indeed penetrated.
There seems little doubt that this was a last desperate attempt to sink as many
as possible of our Fleet before the final and then inevitable surrender, and one
cannot but acknowledge the spirit and the bravery of those who took part in
such a forlorn hope.</p>

</div>

<p>Even more dramatic was the afternoon of Saturday, 21st June, 1919, when
the large majority of the interned vessels sank beneath the waters of the Flow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 542px;">

</div>

<p>In accordance with the terms of the Armistice German crews were allowed
to remain on board the interned ships, and after the preliminary inspection,
there was practically no communication with our own ships except for essential
matters of duty. This rather aided the preparation of the plans made by the
Germans, and shortly after noon on the 21st the sea-cocks of all the vessels were
simultaneously opened, and ensigns, and in some cases the Red Flag, hoisted. The
First Battle Squadron, which was then at the Base, was exercising in the Pentland
Firth at the time, and was not able to return until later in the afternoon, but all
available tugs and small craft were immediately ordered to the sinking ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and as many as possible were run ashore on the surrounding islands. It was a
clear afternoon, and probably no more wonderful sight has ever been witnessed
than that of these huge vessels on all sides heeling over and plunging headlong&mdash;some
with their sterns almost vertical above the water, others listing over to
port or starboard, with steam and oil and air pouring out of the vents and rising
to the surface long after the ships had completely disappeared beneath the water.
D&eacute;bris of all sorts, boats, hammocks, lifebelts, chests, etc., littered the sea for
miles round. Small craft of all descriptions were variously engaged: here a drifter
would be seen picking up Germans from the water, there a pinnace towing a
long string of boats and Carley floats full of prisoners to the Flagship, whilst
other craft were occupied heading off parties of Germans who were endeavouring
to make for the shore. One or two amusing incidents occurred during the
scuttling. One of our water-boats was busily engaged supplying water to one of
the ships as she was sinking, and whilst the Germans were actually leaving the
ship on the other side. Some school children from Stromness in the tug "Flying
Kestrel" had the unique experience of a trip round the ships in the morning,
which on their return journey were sinking or had disappeared.</p>

<p>By five or six o'clock the whole of the ships had sunk, except the battleship
"Baden," which was boarded in time to save her, and three cruisers, which were
run ashore or beached. The battle cruisers "Hindenburg" and "Seydlitz"
drifted into shallow water, and with the cruiser "Bremse," which turned turtle
as she was being beached, are resting on the bottom, and present a spectacle of
interest to visitors as they pass in the Mail Boat to Stromness.</p>

<p>Such was the inglorious end of the German Fleet, and with its disappearance
the Base began slowly to break up. One by one the ships went south, and the
acquaintances of many years were severed. On 15th February, 1920, the Base
reverted to a peace-time status, and the Admiral commanding the Orkneys and
Shetlands (Vice-Admiral Sir R. J. Prendergast) hauled down his flag. Towards
the end of the month and during March the salved German cruisers and destroyers
were towed south to Rosyth for distribution amongst the Allied Powers, and on
25th March the last of the Base ships remaining, H.M.S. "Imperieuse" and
H.M.S. "Victorious," left for Rosyth and Devonport respectively.</p>

<p>To-day not a vessel remains of that vast assemblage of ships which were
gathered at the Base during the war, and Scapa will probably in future be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
exercising base only for the Fleet as in pre-war times. But, whatever its future,
the name of Scapa is one that has earned an undying fame in the history of the
British Empire and of the world, and it will remain as an enduring memory to
those who were destined by the chances of war to be exiled in those lonely islands
of the North.</p>

<h3>KIRKWALL</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_052.png" width="83" height="80" alt="V" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"Voir</span> Kirkwall, et mourir," a French naval officer remarked to me
when visiting Scapa Flow. Without inquiring too closely as to
whether there might not have been some ironical "double-entendre"
in his apparent admiration of the capital of the
Orkneys, it was certainly the Orcadian "Mecca" of the Grand
Fleet, and never in its history has it known such activity and prosperity as during
the five years of war. A sleepy little town of four or five thousand inhabitants, it
was suddenly called upon to assist in supplying the needs of a floating population
of close on 100,000 men, and its narrow main (and only) street, "where two wheelbarrows
tremble when they meet," bustled with unwonted activity&mdash;messmen
from the ships loading provisions, naval men and officers engaged in an afternoon's
shopping and sightseeing, with an occasional motor lorry or car trying to
thread its way amongst the traffic.</p>

<p>Kirkwall, as will be seen from the map, is approached from the Flow by way
of Scapa Pier, whence it is a walk or drive of about a mile and a half to the town.</p>

<p>The little hamlet of Scapa, incidentally, from which the Flow takes its name,
assumed importance during the war as a seaplane station, and is the scene of an
old custom long forgotten, which is related rather amusingly in a volume on
Orkney by a Rev. John Brand, dated 1701. He writes: "In Scapha about a mile
from Kirkwal to South-West, it is said there was kept a large and ancient Cup,
which they say belonged to St. Magnus, King of Norway, who first instructed
them in the principles of the Christian religion and founded the Church of Kirkwal,
with which full of some strong drink their Bishops at their first landing were
presented; which, if he drank it out, they highly praised him, and made themselves
to believe, that they should have many good and fruitful years in his time." He
adds rather regretfully: "The Countrey to this Day have the tradition of this,
but we did not see the cup; nor could we learn where it was." The fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Highland Park Distillery (the most northern distillery in the British Isles)
is on the upper Scapa road rather tends to confirm the legend!</p>

<p>Conveyances known locally as "machines" (they do not speak of traps or
chars-&agrave;-bancs in Orkney) are always available to convey one to Kirkwall from
the Pier, and anyone who has travelled over that bumpy road in one of these
vehicles will not forget the experience!</p>

</div>

<p>Arrived in Kirkwall and suitably refreshed (let me recommend the Ayre
Hotel of many pleasant memories), the most striking building which meets the
eye, and which dominates the town, is the Cathedral of St. Magnus. Kirkwall,
as its name signifies (Kirkevaag or Kirk Voe), is the bay of the church, although
the original church from which the town takes its name was not that of St. Magnus.
Founded before the middle of the twelfth century, it is a very fine example of
Gothic architecture, which, fortunately, owing to its remoteness, escaped the zeal
of the Reformers, and remains to-day a stately witness of the Norse warriors of
old, who played such a prominent and adventurous part in the history of Orkney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Near by are the Bishop's and Earl's Palaces, both also eloquent relics of the days
when feasting and fighting were the main preoccupations of the Norse Jarls,
whose exploits are recounted so graphically in the "Orkneyinga Saga."</p>

</div>

<p>Kirkwall during the war was an examination base, and hundreds of craft
of all nationalities passed through the harbour to be searched for contraband
of war. Later, after the Armistice, it became the headquarters of our own and
the American Mine Clearance Service, and the advent of four or five thousand
American sailors contributed further to the prosperity and enlivenment of the
town. Baseball, for example, and the "jazz," had not hitherto penetrated so
far north as Orkney, and dancing soon became almost as great an obsession
amongst the fair maidens of Kirkwall as it was further south.</p>

<p>To-day Kirkwall is again outwardly the same quiet town it was prior to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
1914, but the infusion of new ideas and modes of life, which was inevitable from
contact with so many of our own and American people, has produced many
changes of mental and social outlook, and in no town will the years 1914-1919
be remembered for their historical significance more than in the capital of the
Orkney Islands.</p>

<h3>STROMNESS</h3>

<p>Stromness, situate at the western extremity of the mainland, is next to Kirkwall
in size, and is in many respects the rival of the capital. Its position did not give
it the same importance as Kirkwall during the war, although it was a convenient
centre for some of the subsidiary activities of the Base. For a considerable
period it was the headquarters of the Western Patrol, and the various building
operations, including the wharf at Lyness and the Air Stations at Houton and
Scapa, were supervised from the office of the Civil Engineer at Stromness. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
accessibility of Stromness to the sea through Hoy and Burra Sounds, and the
probability of submarine attacks on the Fleet through these channels, rendered
defensive measures an imperative necessity, and at the time of the Armistice a triple
series of boom defences, with the additional safeguards of sunken ships and minefields,
rendered ingress a practical impossibility. One of the most remarkable
of these defences was the Clestron Barrier between the island of Graemsay and
Clestron. This was constructed of conical frameworks of steel rails, which were
placed in position with their bases resting on the bottom of the channel, an operation
rendered the more difficult by the tides which sweep around these shores,
which give Stromness its name (the ness of the "strom" or current).</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Stromness from the Sea.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Stromness is a picturesquely situated little town, with its straggling houses,
rising straight from the water's edge, and its rugged coast scenery. The traveller
from Kirkwall, after traversing fifteen miles of somewhat monotonous road, is
suddenly confronted with the quiet town lying below him in a landlocked bay,
with the heights of Hoy rising beyond and adding grandeur to the beauty of the
scene.</p>

<p>Amongst the quaint houses in its zigzag mile-long street is one of noteworthy
interest, being the house in which Sir Walter Scott wrote the notes of his Orkney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
novel, "The Pirate," most of the characters in which are drawn from people
who actually lived in Stromness.</p>

<p>Stromness was a popular "week-end" resort for those who, during the
war and afterwards, were fortunate enough to get leave, there being an excellent
and modern hotel, with good fishing in the lochs, and a nine-hole golf course in
the near neighbourhood. Close at hand, too, are many places of interest to the
historian and antiquarian, which are briefly noticed in the following pages.</p>


<h3>THE STANDING STONES OF STENNIS</h3>

<p>"The Standing Stones" are the most noteworthy antiquarian relic in the
county of Orkney, and their origin, like those of Stonehenge, is wrapped in
obscurity. They were probably erected by the early Celtic inhabitants of Orkney,
possibly as sacrificial spots, and they were undoubtedly standing when the Norsemen
overran the islands in the ninth century. Standing on the narrow little
peninsula in the midst of the Loch of Stennis, and seen as the shadows of evening
are falling, they are impressive in their lonely solemnity, and insensibly carry
one back to the dawn of history in these islands&mdash;to days of sacrificial rites and
strange matrimonial ceremonies, to the worship of Thor and Woden.</p>

</div>


<h3>MAESHOWE</h3>

<p>A mile or two from Stennis stands the celebrated Tumulus of Maeshowe. This
is a conical-shaped mound rising to a height of about 35 feet, and surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a moat. The interior is approached by a long, narrow passage, leading into a
central stone chamber about 15 feet square, from which a number of crypts or
cells branch off at the sides. On the walls are inscribed a number of runes, of
which, as one humourist observed, "several professors have given as many
translations, apparently all different." There is certainly considerable diversity
of opinion as to the age and origin of the mound, but it seems to be generally
accepted that it was originally the chambered tomb of some chieftain, dating
from early Celtic times.</p>

</div>


<h3>HOY</h3>

<p>The island of Hoy lies on the western side of the Flow, and, as most of the Base
ships were anchored in its vicinity, it was the island which became the most
familiar to and frequented by those going to the "beach" for recreation and
exercise. The names of Long Hope, Lyness, Melsetter, North Ness, are as familiar
to the many thousands of naval men who spent so long at Scapa, as are the Strand
and Charing Cross to Londoners. Fortunately, Hoy is perhaps the most interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and picturesque of the Orkney Islands, and some of its hill and cliff scenery is
amongst the finest in Great Britain, whilst the sportsman, the botanist, and the
geologist can find ample material for their various pursuits.</p>

<p>Hoy will probably show more permanent evidences of the "naval invasion"
of Scapa Flow than any of the other islands, as it has now become, at Lyness,
the headquarters of the permanent peace-time naval establishment at Scapa Flow.
At Lyness there are the makings of a miniature dockyard, with a wharf accommodating
vessels of 30 feet draught, slipway, storesheds, oil, fuel, and petrol
dep&ocirc;ts, and a reservoir for fresh water supply, which, in the event of war, would be
at once available for meeting the requirements of the Fleet. Such an establishment
would have been of immense value at the outbreak of the present war, and,
indeed, had been contemplated for some years prior to 1914.</p>

<h3>WARD HILL, HOY</h3>

<p>Ward Hill is the highest hill in Orkney (1,556 feet), and from its summit on
a clear day a magnificent panorama of the Orkney Islands unfolds itself, lying
at one's feet like "the scattered fragments of some ingenious and parti-coloured
toy map," whilst on the further side of the Pentland Firth the coast of Scotland
is clearly defined as far as Cape Wrath. During the war the whole of the Grand
Fleet could be seen in the Flow, and it seemed hard to realise that those small
and insignificant specks as they appeared in the distance lay as a "sure shield of
Empire" between our nation and the domination of the German Eagle.</p>

<h3>THE OLD MAN OF HOY</h3>

<p>The lonely pillar of rock standing well out on the western coast of Hoy is
one of the best-known "sights" of Orkney. It stands 450 feet above the sea
(as high as St. Paul's Cathedral) in one of the most inaccessible parts of the coast,
but the scene repays the hard walk over the moors which a visit to the rock
entails. The photo happens to show the features of the "Old Man" quite
distinctly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE DWARFIE STONE</h3>

<p>The Dwarfie Stone is one of the strange relics of antiquity which abound in
Orkney. It is a mass of sandstone about 30 feet in length, 14 feet in breadth, and
from 2 to 6 feet in height, and lies in a lonely valley at the foot of Ward Hill. It
has been hollowed out on either side of the entrance door shown in the photo into
two chambers, each with a stone bed, with a hole in the roof to serve as a window or
chimney. Nothing appears to be known of the origin or purpose of the stone, but a
rather quaint theory is brought forward in an old book on Orkney (1701), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who hewed this stone, or for what use it was, we could not learn, the
Common Tradition among the People is, That a giant with his wife lived in this
Isle of Hoy, who had this stone for their Castle. But I would rather think, seeing
it could not accommodate any of a Gigantick stature, that it might be for the use of
some Dwarf, as the name seems to import, or it being remote from any House might
be the retired Cell of some Melancholick Hermite. The stone also may be called the
Dwarfie Stone, per Antiphrasin or by way of Opposition it being so very great."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 544px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Dwarfie Stone.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott refers to the stone at some length in his novel "The Pirate,"
the scene of which is laid in the Orkneys and Shetlands, and which will be found
of interest to the student of Orkney traditions and history.</p>

</div>

<p>Following the rough road on the east coast of Hoy from Ward Hill, by way
of Pegal Burn, one reaches Lyness, in pre-war days a few scattered crofts, and
now the Naval Base in Orkney.
The stone wharf, built by Messrs.
Kinnear and Moodie, of Glasgow,
is now only just nearing completion,
and the other buildings
(torpedo and paravane dep&ocirc;ts,
petrol tanks, store sheds, etc.)
were not available in time to be
of much value during the war,
but they will be ready for the
next! Some idea of the difficulties
with which the contractors
had to contend will be realised, when it is remembered that every ton of material
had to be brought by rail and sea from the south, during a time when, owing to
the submarine menace and the
shortage of shipping, it was often
months before delivery of stores
could be made. The work was
frequently completely held up
by non-delivery of a machine or
replacement, whilst the difficulties
of recruiting labour in such
a desolate spot as the Orkneys
were a great handicap. On
many days work had to be
suspended owing to gales, whilst
in winter operations were only
practicable during the few
hours of daylight available. The works, incidentally, were responsible for the
introduction of the first train into Orkney!</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sunset over the Martello Tower, Crockness.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Crockness lies a little beyond Lyness, to the south, and is chiefly noteworthy
for its Martello Tower, which, with that at Hackness on the further side of Long
Hope Bay, was erected during
the Napoleonic Wars, and completed
in 1818 as a protection
for the harbour. It was in Long
Hope Harbour that merchantmen
bound for America and the
Continent assembled to await
convoy, and it is curious that
exactly one hundred years later
history has repeated itself, and
that during the war just concluded
the same system of convoy
was adopted from Kirkwall,
into which harbour all neutral vessels were sent for examination and convoy.
It is rather characteristic of our nation that both the Martello Towers and
the works at Lyness were completed some time after the Napoleonic Wars and
the European War respectively
were over!</p>

</div>

<p>The Towers are very solidly
built structures, with gun mountings
on top, and underground
cellars for stowing ammunition,
etc., but they have never apparently
been of any practical
use. It is related that it was
not until the present war that a
monthly payment, which originated
in 1818, to a crofter family
for certain services rendered to
the original occupants of the
Tower, was at length discontinued, when it was discovered that the Tower had been
disused for some generations! but the accuracy of the story cannot be vouched for.</p>

<h3>LONG HOPE</h3>

<p>Continuing by the road from Crockness, the village of Melsetter is passed on
the road to Long Hope.</p>

<p>At Melsetter is the very fine residence of Mr. and Mrs. Middlemore, whose
hospitality was always open to the many naval officers who used to call there.
The visitors' book among many famous names contains those of the King and
the Prince of Wales, and Admirals Jellicoe and Beatty. A William Morris
Tapestry in one of the reception rooms is noteworthy as recording the exploits of
"Sir Gawaine of Orkney," one of the Knights of the Round Table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Melsetter&mdash;on the Road from Lyness to Long Hope.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Long Hope Bay during the war was the headquarters of the auxiliaries of the
Grand Fleet, and never in its history were so many vessels of such varied types
assembled in the harbour. The village of Long Hope, where there is a good pier,
naturally became much frequented by officers and men from the ships, and
eventually a commodious Y.M.C.A. was erected, which did much useful work.
"Tea on the beach" was always a pleasant change from ship life (and tinned milk!),
and the Post Office at Long Hope became a favourite rendezvous for informal
tea-parties. (Possibly the attractions of the fair postmistress and her sister
had something to do with this!)</p>

<p>Incidentally, a writer on Orkney remarks that "there is a considerable Celtic
element in the population of South Walls brought by some seventy-one Highlanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
who, evicted from Strathnaver to make room for sheep, settled in the parish
between 1788 and 1795, and who have thrown in a dash of good looks not so
common in other parts of the group." The comment seems hardly fair to the
rest of Orkney, however true it may be with regard to Walls.</p>

Fleet) was transformed into the office of the Admiral Commanding the Orkneys and
Shetlands, and a wireless station was erected alongside. It has now (1921) reverted
to its pre-war condition, much to the gratification of the Long Hope inhabitants.</p>

<h3>KIRK HOPE AND CANTICK</h3>

<p>The road from Long Hope leads past the Y.M.C.A. to the lonely little cemetery
(shown on the left of the photo above) at Kirk Hope, and thence to the lighthouse
at Cantick Head. A fine view of the islands is obtained from the Lighthouse
Tower, and the visitors' book contains the names of R. L. Stevenson and
Prince Albert, amongst others of interest.</p>

<h3>PEATS</h3>

<p>As there are practically no trees in Orkney, wood is not available for fuel, but
fortunately peat is very plentiful, and is used almost universally for heating
purposes. The peats are cut in the spring, and a peculiar-shaped form of spade,
known as a toysker, is employed to cut the turfs, which are stacked on the side
of the bank as shown in the
photograph. After a few weeks
the peats are "raised"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, set
on end&mdash;and arranged in small
heaps, so that they may dry
more thoroughly. They are then
carted home and stacked, each
croft possessing its stack for the
winter months.</p>

</div>

<p>During the war parties of
men from the ships could often
be seen assisting the crofters in
digging the peats&mdash;such assistance being very welcome at a time when labour
was scarce and there was plenty of work to be done on the land. A day at
the peats can be recommended to anyone who wants to know what it is to feel
really tired after a hard day's work!</p>

<p>The primitive cottages which prevailed in Orkney, until a few years ago, are
gradually giving way to larger and more substantial dwellings, but some of the
crofts are still reminiscent of very early times, consisting only of a "but and a
ben," with the beds let into the wall, after the style of the French cupboard beds
of Brittany, and with the floors made of stone flags.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Orkney has several cottage industries, no doubt due to the long winter
evenings and the inclement weather. Amongst these is rush plaiting for the
famous "Orkney chairs," which, with their comfortable rush backs and seats and
hoods, are familiar to all who have been in Orkney.</p>

<h3>SPINNING</h3>

<p>Spinning is another occupation of the winter evenings, which has been widely
revived recently in Orkney owing to the high price of wool. The Orkneys and
Shetlands are noted for the softness and quality of their wool, and the various
processes of teasing, carding, spinning and dyeing are all carried out on the
crofts.</p>

more or less self-explanatory. Owing to limitations of space, it is
not possible to deal adequately with a subject on which so many
volumes have been written, but an effort has been made to include
as many types as possible of the varied units of the Grand Fleet, and to depict
the various phases of the everyday life and recreations of the personnel of the Fleet.
Owing to the strict photographic censorship during the war, it was not practicable
to take many subjects which would otherwise have found a place in this record,
but those which are shown in the following pages will give the reader some little
idea of how the Navy "carried on" during the eventful years 1914-1919.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the association of the Grand Fleet with Scapa Flow
would of itself have given that hitherto almost unknown spot a
peculiar and honourable significance in our naval history, it was
undoubtedly the choice of Scapa as the place of internment of the
German ships and their subsequent dramatic sinking, which made
Scapa a familiar name, not only in this country but all over the world. The
photographs which follow show the various phases of the German "occupation"
of Scapa from the time that the vessels arrived for internment to the final scenes
in March, 1920, when those vessels which had been salved after the scuttling
in June, 1919, were finally towed south for distribution amongst the Allied
Powers.</p>

<p>The first phase took place on 23rd November, 1918, and the succeeding days,
when the surrendered ships were escorted from Rosyth to Scapa and anchored
in the Flow, prior to taking up their permanent billets in Gutter Sound (previously
the collier anchorage of the Fleet; see map on <a href="#ANCHORAGE">p. 110</a>).</p>

<p>The ships arrived in the following order:</p>

<p>The German ships carried full navigating parties, and came north under their
own steam. The dense clouds of smoke which will be observed in the photographs
on <a href="#SEYDLITZ">pp. 102</a> and <a href="#MOLTKE">103</a> testify to the poor quality of the coal with which they were
supplied. The crews were later reduced to care and maintenance parties only.</p>

<p>During the period of their internment, communication between the German
ships and our own Fleet was restricted to a minimum, and no one from our own
ships was allowed on board the interned vessels unless on duty of an urgent nature.
The Germans were required to victual and store their own ships from Germany,
coal and water only being supplied locally. As German warships were not constructed
for living aboard for long periods (the sailors being mostly accommodated
in barracks when in harbour), the crews at Scapa must have had a rather unenviable
time of it, though there was a certain element of poetic justice in interning
them in the region where for so long our own Fleet had kept its lonely vigil. As
one of their officers remarked in writing home and describing the bleakness and
desolation of Scapa: "If the English have stood this for four years, they deserve
to have won the war."</p>

<p>The German ships were patrolled by a number of drifters&mdash;a somewhat
ignominious guard for the much-vaunted German Fleet.</p>

<p>The Germans' love of music was in evidence even at Scapa, and it was somewhat
strange and at times rather pathetic to hear the unfamiliar strains of "Die
Wacht am Rhein" and "Die Lorelei" rising from the German ships, some of
which still retained their bands.</p>

<p>The anniversary of Jutland (31st May) was not forgotten, and most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
ships displayed bunting, on the pretext of drying their flags, as they were not
allowed to fly their ensigns after Beatty's signal on the evening of the surrender
at Rosyth. One of the ships prominently displayed a notice in English: "To-day
we celebrate the German victory of the Battle of Jutland."</p>

<span class="smallc">(One of the ships which bombarded Scarborough.)</span></div>
</div>

<p>It was somewhat difficult, owing to the isolation of the German ships, to form
an idea of the discipline which prevailed on board. It was evident that on most
of the ships there were representatives of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Councils, as the
members could be readily distinguished by their white armlets. Indeed, there
is probably some truth in the report that when the German ships surrendered,
the crews confidently expected that our ships, the crews of which they believed
to be on the verge of mutiny and Bolshevism, would make common cause with
them, and they must have been considerably surprised when Admiral Beatty
refused to negotiate with the Council representatives. There were undoubtedly
disturbances on some of the German ships whilst they were at Scapa, and it
appears to have been due to a rather serious case of insubordination that Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Von Reuter, who was in command of the German ships, changed his flagship from
the "Friedrich der Grosse" to the "Emden."</p>

<p>On the other hand, the simultaneous sinking of the German ships on 21st June,
1919, proved conclusively that a certain discipline still prevailed, for the scuttling
was undoubtedly organised and carried out with (from the German point of view)
very commendable precision and thoroughness.</p>

<p>The scuttling of the German ships on 21st June, 1919, has already been briefly
referred to in the earlier part of the book, but as the writer was privileged to be
an eyewitness of the events of that afternoon, the reader will perhaps pardon the
intrusion of the personal element in a more detailed description of the sinkings.</p>

<p>It was at five minutes past noon that the signalmen reported that the German
ships had hoisted ensigns and burgees. The excitement which this announcement
produced was intensified a short time later when it became apparent that the
ships were sinking, and that the crews were taking to the boats. Lunch was
completely forgotten, and arrangements were hurriedly made to get all available
small craft to the ships to ascertain if anything could be done to save any of them.
I obtained permission from the Admiral to accompany him on an inspection of
some of the nearer destroyers, from which it was ascertained that there was
no possibility of saving any of the ships other than by beaching them, as the sea-cocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
had not been only opened but the valves had been destroyed. Our picket-boat
happened to come alongside at this stage, so I jumped aboard and proceeded
north up Gutter Sound, where the larger vessels were anchored. Our instructions
were to board any German vessels which were still afloat, haul down their ensigns,
and to take such steps as were necessary to save life and to direct any boats or
Carley floats of Germans to the Flagship. Our picket-boat followed the course
shown in the sketch map on <a href="#ANCHORAGE">p. 110</a>, and we reached the "Seydlitz" at about one
o'clock, boarded her and hauled down her colours, and at the same time opened
the windlass with a view to parting it and allowing the vessel to drift ashore, but
unfortunately it brought up at the slip and held. The "Seydlitz" was then
beginning to list heavily, so we left her and next boarded the "Hindenburg,"
which was also beginning to list heavily to port.</p>

</div>

<p>We then proceeded past several of the battleships, which were seen to be
rapidly settling down. Whilst abreast of "K&ouml;nig Albert," our picket-boat was
hailed from the deck of a trawler by the German Admiral, Von Reuter, who asked
us to save the crew of the "Bayern," who were in the water. Two drifters which
were near by were accordingly ordered close to the "Bayern" for this purpose,
and we proceeded in the same direction, when the photographs on <a href="#BAYERN">pp. 112</a> and <a href="#BAYERN2">113</a>
were taken. Immediately afterwards the ship turned over to port, bottom up,
and sank, whilst the crews of the boats cheered loudly and waved their caps.</p>

<p>We next headed for the "Derfflinger," on the way sending back several
boats full of Germans to the "Victorious." The "Derfflinger" foundered a
few minutes after taking the photograph on <a href="#DERFLINGER">p. 24</a>. On the way back we
passed the "Hindenburg," which had then settled on to an even keel with her
masts and funnels showing, whilst the "Seydlitz" was then resting in shallow
water on her starboard side, with her decks nearly vertical, and her port propeller
just showing above the water.</p>

<p>Meantime a considerable number of the destroyers had been beached by
tugs and other small craft, in addition to three cruisers, whilst the "Baden," the
only battleship saved, was still afloat, though very low in the water.</p>

<p>On arrival on the "Victorious" we found the ship crowded with Germans,
who, after examination, were sent to the Flagship, H.M.S. "Revenge"&mdash;which had
by this time returned to the Flow from the Pentland, where the 1st Battle Squadron
had been exercising&mdash;from which ship they were sent south.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>A large amount of salvage work ensued on the vessels which had been beached,
most of them being pumped out and docked in the Floating Dock, although it
was not found possible to get some of the destroyers off, and these still remain as
a memento of that eventful day.</p>

<p>All the salved ex-German ships have now been towed south, and have been
apportioned amongst the Allied Powers. It is interesting to note that the
"Baden" and "Nurnberg," of which several photographs are shown in the
following pages, have been allotted to Great Britain, whilst the "Emden" goes
to France, and the "Frankfurt" to U.S.A. It appears that most of the salved
vessels are to be broken up, thus finally disposing of the remnants of the once
great German Fleet.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A few</span> notes remain to be added to the preceding pages to
complete the story of Scapa to the present time. The war
necessarily left its aftermath at Scapa, as elsewhere, and although
much of the "clearing up" has been accomplished, there will
remain for many years visible traces of the "naval occupation"
of the Orkneys.</p>

<p>The signing of the Armistice in November, 1918, entailed only a cessation of
active hostilities, and it was not until the summer of 1919 that the reversion of
the Base from a war to a peace footing really began. One of the earliest and most
important operations to be undertaken after the Armistice was the clearance of
the North Sea mine barrage between the Orkneys and Norway, which has already
been briefly referred to. This entailed a sweep over an area of 6,000 square
miles, and the destruction of over 70,000 mines. The American Minesweeping
Detachment, to which the major portion of this task was allotted, arrived in
Kirkwall in April, 1919, and by the end of September of that year their task
had been successfully accomplished, and the northern gateway was open once
more to the mercantile traffic of the world.</p>

<p>The mines which had been laid in the smaller areas around the entrances to
the Flow were exploded simultaneously in sections&mdash;a very much simpler task,
as these were connected electrically to shore stations. The photographs on
<a href="#BLOWINGUP">p. 140</a> give some idea of the force of the explosions, which were audible for
miles around. It is of interest to note that the buoy shown on the left of the
photograph on the lower part of <a href="#CLOSERVIEW2">p. 140</a> marks the resting-place of the German
submarine which was sunk in this minefield a few days before the Armistice.</p>

<p>The removal of the booms and the release of the boom defence drifters and
trawlers was completed before the end of 1919. The fishermen who formed the
crews of these vessels, incidentally, deserve to be recognised for their work during
the war, the monotony and isolation of which made their task one of the least
enviable at the Base.</p>

<p>The raising of the barrier at Clestron (see <a href="#CLESTRON">p. 39</a>) proved a more formidable
operation. The ice-breaker "Sviagator," early in 1920, made the unique experiment
of crushing some of the hurdles to a sufficient depth to allow vessels of medium
draught to pass over with safety, but it was not until the summer of 1920 that the
removal of the hurdles was undertaken and completed by a salvage company, and
the rails shipped south.</p>

<p>The raising of the "block" ships, which had been sunk in some of the narrow
channels leading into the Flow, appears to have presented almost insuperable
difficulties, mainly owing to tidal currents, and there does not seem to be much
likelihood that the vessels in Burra and Water Sounds will ever be raised. In
Holm Sound, however, one of the sunken ships, S.S. "Aorangi," was successfully
salved by the East Coast Wrecking Company on 8th September, 1920, and beached
near the churchyard at Holm.</p>

<p>Of the temporary shore establishments at Scapa very little now remains, and
the buildings which are still standing have nearly all been converted to meet peace-time
requirements. The "miniature base" at Lyness is in the hands of caretakers,
and the completion of the wharf (on which &pound;300,000 has been spent) has been
stopped, whilst the control of the Naval Area, which since February, 1920, had
been in the hands of Captain Alan G. Bruce, R.N., C.B., D.S.O., was on 1st December,
1920, removed to Invergordon.</p>

<p>The air stations at Houton, Smoogro, Caldale, and Stenness have been closed
down or removed, whilst the seaplane station at Scapa has been acquired by the
Orkney County Council as a tuberculosis hospital. Nearly all the shore batteries
have been dismantled, the guns removed, the searchlights withdrawn, and the
huts sold or demolished. Only at Hoy (Stromness) are the batteries intact, but
these are in charge of a civilian caretaker. The Royal Marine Station at Carness
(near Kirkwall) remains, but as a smallpox hospital under the Orkney County
Council.</p>

<p>Various schemes have been under consideration for the removal of the sunken
German ships, but at present they still remain as they sank on the memorable
21st June, 1919&mdash;a constant source of danger to ships passing through the narrow
channels where they lie. It remains to be seen whether steps will eventually be
taken to remove the more dangerous of these vessels, or whether they will remain
as a permanent memorial of one of the most dramatic episodes of naval history.</p>
